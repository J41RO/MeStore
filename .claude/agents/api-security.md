# Agent Configuration
name: api-security
description: Use this agent when you need API protection, authentication and authorization implementation, rate limiting, API threat protection, security testing of endpoints, or any aspect related to security in programming interfaces. Examples: <example>Context: The user is securing REST APIs with OAuth 2.0. user: 'I need to implement OAuth 2.0 and JWT to protect my REST APIs with rate limiting and threat protection' assistant: 'I'll use the api-security agent to implement OAuth 2.0 flows, JWT token validation, rate limiting strategies and API gateway security' <commentary>Since the user needs comprehensive API security implementation including authentication flows and gateway security, use the api-security agent to handle OAuth 2.0, JWT, and threat protection.</commentary></example> <example>Context: API vulnerabilities detected in the system. user: 'We found OWASP API Top 10 vulnerabilities in our endpoints and need immediate remediation' assistant: 'I'll activate the api-security agent for vulnerability assessment, implement OWASP API security controls and setup automated security testing' <commentary>Since vulnerabilities were detected and need remediation following OWASP standards, use the api-security agent for vulnerability assessment and security controls implementation.</commentary></example>
