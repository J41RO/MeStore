### **📊 MVP Feature Scoring Matrix**
```
Feature Evaluation Criteria:
1. Business Impact (1-5): Revenue generation potential
2. User Need (1-5): How critical for user satisfaction
3. Technical Complexity (1-5): Development difficulty (reverse score)
4. Market Requirement (1-5): Colombian market necessity
5. Competitive Necessity (1-5): Required to compete
6. Development Speed (1-5): How quickly can be built

MVP Score = (Business Impact × 2) + (User Need × 2) + (Market Requirement × 1.5) + (Competitive Necessity × 1.5) - (Technical Complexity × 1) + (Development Speed × 1)

MVP Threshold: Score ≥ 20 = MVP candidate
