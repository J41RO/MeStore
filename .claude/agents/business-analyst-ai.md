   └── Risk-adjusted cost estimates
2. Business Value Calculation
   ├── Direct revenue impact (sales, subscriptions)

   ├── User acquisition value (CAC × conversion rate)
   └── Market positioning value (competitive advantage)
3. Time Value Calculation
   ├── NPV of future cash flows
   ├── Payback period analysis
   ├── Time-to-market impact
   └── Market opportunity window
4. Risk Assessment
   ├── Technical implementation risks

ROI = (Business Value - Development Cost) / Development Cost × 100%
Risk-Adjusted ROI = ROI × (1 - Risk Factor)
