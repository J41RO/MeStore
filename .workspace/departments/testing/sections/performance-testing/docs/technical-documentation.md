## Overview
Enterprise performance testing framework for MeStore marketplace with focus on admin management system scalability and SLA compliance.

## Current Mission
Implement comprehensive performance testing for admin_management.py (748 lines) with advanced load testing, stress testing, and capacity planning for enterprise RBAC system.

## Architecture Analysis

### Target System: admin_management.py
- **Complexity**: 748 lines of enterprise RBAC code
- **Critical Operations**: Admin creation, permission management, bulk operations
- **Database Intensity**: Complex joins, permission lookups, audit logging
- **Concurrency Risks**: Multiple admins modifying permissions simultaneously

### Performance Critical Endpoints

#### High-Volume Operations
1. `GET /admins` - Complex filtering with search and pagination
2. `POST /admins/bulk-action` - Mass operations up to 100 users
3. `GET /admins/{id}/permissions` - Exhaustive permission listings
4. `POST /admins/{id}/permissions/grant` - Multi-permission assignments

#### Database-Intensive Operations
- Complex queries with User + AdminPermission + ActivityLog joins
- Permission count aggregations with subqueries
- Audit log insertions with every operation
- Transaction-heavy bulk operations

### SLA Requirements

#### Response Time Targets
- GET endpoints: <200ms (p95), <500ms (p99)
- POST/PUT endpoints: <500ms (p95), <1000ms (p99)
- Bulk operations: <2000ms (p95), <5000ms (p99)
- Complex queries: <300ms (p95), <800ms (p99)

#### Throughput Targets
- Regular endpoints: >500 RPS sustained
- Admin creation: >50 RPS sustained
- Permission operations: >100 RPS sustained
- Bulk operations: >10 RPS sustained

#### Scalability Targets
- 1000+ concurrent users
- 10,000+ admin records
- 100,000+ permission assignments
- 1M+ audit log entries

## Testing Framework Architecture

### Load Testing Tools
- **Locust**: Distributed load generation for realistic user patterns
- **k6**: Performance scripting with JavaScript for complex scenarios
- **Apache Bench**: Quick benchmarking for individual endpoints
- **Custom Python**: AsyncIO-based concurrent testing

### Performance Monitoring
- **Database Profiling**: PostgreSQL EXPLAIN ANALYZE integration
- **Memory Profiling**: py-spy and memray for leak detection
- **APM Simulation**: New Relic/DataDog pattern implementation
- **Real-time Metrics**: Performance dashboard with live SLA monitoring

### Test Categories

#### Load Testing (Normal Operation)
- Sustained traffic simulation (500 RPS)
- Peak hour patterns (Colombian business hours)
- Mixed workload scenarios (CRUD + permissions)
- Realistic data distribution

#### Stress Testing (Breaking Points)
- Gradual load increase until failure
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Connection pool limit testing
- Memory pressure validation

#### Scalability Testing
- Horizontal scaling simulation
- Database bottleneck identification
- Cache effectiveness under load
- Background task performance

#### Endurance Testing
- 24-hour sustained operations
- Memory leak detection
- Performance degradation monitoring
- Resource cleanup validation

## Dependencies and Integration

### Required Services
- PostgreSQL with realistic data volumes
- Redis for session and cache testing
- FastAPI application under test
- Background task processors

### Test Data Requirements
- 10,000+ realistic admin users
- 100,000+ permission assignments
- 1M+ audit log entries
- Complex department/role hierarchies

## Reporting and SLA Compliance

### Performance Metrics
- Response time percentiles (p50, p90, p95, p99)
- Throughput measurements (RPS) under load
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Database query performance analysis
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Error rates and failure patterns

### SLA Compliance Reporting
- Real-time SLA violation detection
- Performance trend analysis and forecasting
- Bottleneck identification and recommendations
- Capacity planning based on growth projections
- Performance regression detection across releases

- **Low Risk**: Individual admin CRUD operations
- **Critical**: Database connection pool exhaustion
- **Monitoring**: Memory leaks in long-running operations
