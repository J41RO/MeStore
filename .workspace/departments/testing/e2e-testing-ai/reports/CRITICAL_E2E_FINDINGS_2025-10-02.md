**Test Date:** 2025-10-02

**Environment:** Production-like (http://192.168.1.137:8000)
**Report ID:** E2E-2025-10-02-001

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

### Issue #1: ZERO STOCK ACROSS ALL PRODUCTS - CHECKOUT IMPOSSIBLE

**Severity:** üî¥ **CRITICAL - BUSINESS BLOCKER**

**Description:**
All 19 products in the marketplace currently have `stock_disponible = 0`. This means:
- ‚úÖ Users CAN browse products
- ‚úÖ Users CAN add products to cart
- ‚ùå Users CANNOT complete checkout (order creation will fail with "Insufficient stock" error)
- ‚ùå Payment flows CANNOT be tested end-to-end with real checkout

**Evidence:**
```bash
curl "http://192.168.1.137:8000/api/v1/products/?limit=100"
# Result: 19 products, ALL with stock_disponible=0
```

**Sample Products with Zero Stock:**
1. Secador de Pelo Philips 2300W Profesional - Stock: 0, Price: 185,000 COP
2. Perfume Dior Sauvage 100ml - Stock: 0, Price: 450,000 COP
3. Aud√≠fonos Sony WH-1000XM5 - Stock: 0, Price: 1,180,000 COP
4. ... (16 more products, all with 0 stock)

**Business Impact:**
- üí∞ **Revenue Impact:** ZERO sales possible - complete revenue loss
- üë• **User Impact:** Users will see products but cannot purchase - severe UX degradation
- üìä **Conversion Rate:** 0% conversion rate guaranteed
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time to Fix:** Immediate action required

**Root Cause Analysis Required:**
1. Is this a data issue (inventory not loaded)?
2. Is this a vendor onboarding issue (no vendors have added stock)?
3. Is this a testing environment issue?
4. Is stock tracking/updates broken?

**Immediate Action Required:**
- [ ] Database team: Verify inventory data integrity
- [ ] Vendor team: Check if vendors can add/update stock
- [ ] Product team: Add test products with stock > 0
- [ ] Business team: Notify stakeholders of zero-sales situation

## üîç PAYMENT API ENDPOINTS ANALYSIS

Despite being unable to complete full E2E flows, I analyzed the payment API structure:

### Available Payment Methods (from `/api/v1/payments/methods`)

**Expected Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "card_enabled": true,
  "pse_enabled": true,
  "nequi_enabled": false,
  "cash_enabled": true,
  "wompi_public_key": "pub_test_...",
  "environment": "sandbox",
  "pse_banks": [
    { "financial_institution_code": "1007", "financial_institution_name": "BANCOLOMBIA" },
    ...
  ],
  "currency": "COP",
  "min_amount": 1000,
  "max_amount": 5000000000
}
```

### Payment Gateway Endpoints

#### 1. PayU Credit Card
```bash
POST /api/v1/payments/process/payu
{
  "order_id": "...",
  "amount": 5000000,  # in cents
  "currency": "COP",
  "payment_method": "CREDIT_CARD",
  "payer_email": "...",
  "payer_full_name": "...",
  "card_number": "4111111111111111",  # test card
  "card_expiration_date": "2025/12",
  "card_security_code": "123",
  "card_holder_name": "...",
  "installments": 1
}
```

#### 2. PSE Bank Transfer

## üéØ SHIPPING_STATE FIELD VALIDATION

**Context:** There was a previous issue with `shipping_state` field causing HTTP 400 errors.

**Current Status:** ‚è∏Ô∏è CANNOT VALIDATE (blocked by stock issue)

**Expected Validation:**
1. Order creation payload MUST include `shipping_state` field
2. Backend MUST accept `shipping_state` without HTTP 400 error
3. Order response MUST include `shipping_state` in `shipping_info` object

**Test Payload (blocked):**
```json
{
  "items": [{"product_id": "...", "quantity": 1}],
  "shipping_name": "Juan Test",
  "shipping_phone": "+57 300 1234567",
  "shipping_email": "test@test.com",
  "shipping_address": "Calle 100 #45-67",
  "shipping_city": "Bogot√°",
  "shipping_state": "Cundinamarca",  // ‚Üê CRITICAL FIELD
  "shipping_postal_code": "110111"
}
```

**Recommendation:** Once stock issue is resolved, immediately re-run order creation tests to validate shipping_state handling.

## üìã UX ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue #1: Stock Display vs. Purchase Capability
**Severity:** üü° MEDIUM (becomes CRITICAL with current stock levels)

**Problem:**
- Frontend shows products that users cannot purchase
- No clear indication of "Out of Stock" until checkout attempt
- User experience: Browse ‚Üí Add to Cart ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí ERROR (bad UX)

**Recommendation:**
- Add "Out of Stock" badge on product cards
- Disable "Add to Cart" button for products with stock = 0
- Show stock availability prominently on product pages
- Consider hiding products with 0 stock from marketplace browse

### Issue #2: Error Messaging for Stock Validation
**Severity:** üü¢ LOW

**Recommendation:**
- Ensure clear, user-friendly error messages when stock validation fails
- Provide alternative product suggestions when items are out of stock
- Notify users immediately if cart items become out of stock
