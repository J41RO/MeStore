#### Authentication & Security (15 tests)
```bash
File: tests/api/test_critical_endpoints_mvp.py
- test_refresh_token_success                    # Auth flow
- test_logout_success                          # Session cleanup
- test_get_payment_methods_success             # Payment auth

```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY (Week 2) - 60 Tests

#### Vendor Management (35 tests)
```bash
File: tests/api/test_vendor_endpoints.py
- Entire test suite skipped                    # All vendor functionality

Issue: Performance optimization during development
Solution: Re-enable with optimized test data and fixtures
```

#### Product Management (33 tests)
```bash
File: tests/api/test_productos.py
- Entire test suite skipped                    # All product functionality

```

#### Product Upload (9 tests)
```bash
File: tests/api/test_productos_upload.py
- Entire test suite skipped                    # File upload functionality

Reason: "Product upload tests - performance optimization during database work"
Issue: File handling complexity during optimization
Solution: Mock file operations and enable testing
```

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Week 3) - 35 Tests

#### Vendor Analytics (18 tests)
```bash
File: tests/api/test_vendor_analytics.py
- Entire test suite skipped                    # WebSocket analytics

```

#### Banking Profiles (3 tests)
```bash
File: tests/api/test_perfil_bancarios.py
- Entire test suite skipped                    # Banking integration

Reason: "Banking profile tests - performance optimization during database work"
Issue: External banking service dependencies
Solution: Mock banking services and enable testing
```

#### Payment History (1 test)
```bash
File: tests/api/test_pagos_historial.py
- test_get_historial_pagos_basic               # Payment history

Reason: "Database performance optimization - test incompatible with current setup"
Issue: Database performance issues
Solution: Optimize database queries and enable
```

#### Health Endpoints (1 test)
```bash
File: tests/api/test_health.py
- test_health_full_v1_endpoint                 # Health check

Reason: "Endpoint dependency injection issues during testing"
Issue: Dependency injection conflicts
Solution: Fix dependency setup and enable
```

#### Orders Authentication & Error Handling (12 tests)
```bash
File: tests/api/test_orders_endpoints.py
- TestOrdersAuthentication (6 methods)         # Auth testing

Issue: Complex test setup during optimization
Solution: Simplify test setup and re-enable
```

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY (Week 4) - 18 Tests

#### Debugging Tests (8 tests)
```bash
File: tests/debugging/test_duplicados_corregido.py
File: tests/debugging/test_log_rotation.py
- Entire debugging test suites skipped

Reason: "Debugging tests - performance optimization during database work"
Issue: Debugging tests not needed in CI/CD
Solution: Keep disabled or move to separate test category
```

#### Performance & Optimization (10 tests)
```bash
Various files with optimization-related skips
- Complex validation testing
- Performance testing incompatible with current setup

Reason: "Performance optimization during development"
Issue: Tests conflict with performance work
Solution: Re-enable after performance optimization complete
```

## üõ†Ô∏è ENABLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Week 1: Critical Foundation Tests

#### Day 1-2: Authentication System
```python
# Fix: tests/api/test_critical_endpoints_mvp.py
# Issues: Async dependency injection

# Solution Pattern:
@pytest.fixture
async def async_auth_client():
    async with AsyncClient() as client:
        # Proper async client setup
        yield client

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_refresh_token_success(async_auth_client, mock_db, mock_user):
    # Remove skip decorator
    # Use proper async patterns
    response = await async_auth_client.post("/api/v1/auth/refresh")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

#### Day 3-4: Payment System Foundation
```python
# Fix: tests/api/test_payments_endpoints.py
# Issues: External service mocking

# Solution: Create Wompi Mock Service
@pytest.fixture
def mock_wompi_service():
    with patch('app.services.payments.wompi_service.WompiService') as mock:
        mock.create_payment_intent.return_value = {
            "id": "test_payment_id",
            "status": "pending"
        }
        yield mock

# Enable tests one by one with proper mocking
class TestPaymentsEndpoints:
    def test_create_payment_intent_success(self, mock_wompi_service):
        # Test implementation with mock
        pass
```

#### Day 5: Order Processing Foundation
```python
# Fix: tests/api/test_orders_endpoints.py

    app.dependency_overrides[get_db] = lambda: mock_db
    yield TestClient(app)
    app.dependency_overrides.clear()
```

### Week 2: Core Business Logic

#### Day 1-3: Vendor Management
```python

        "name": "Test Vendor",
        "email": "test@vendor.com",
        "document": "123456789"
    }

# Remove pytestmark skip and enable tests incrementally
def test_vendor_registration(minimal_vendor_data):
    # Streamlined test with minimal data
    pass
```

#### Day 4-5: Product Management
```python
# Fix: tests/api/test_productos.py

# Solution: Lightweight product fixtures
@pytest.fixture
def minimal_product():
    return {
        "name": "Test Product",
        "price": 100.0,
        "category_id": 1
    }

# Enable tests with optimized fixtures

    # Fast test with minimal data
    pass
```

### Week 3: Advanced Features

#### Day 1-2: Vendor Analytics
```python

#### Day 4-5: Final Validation
- Run full test suite
- Validate coverage targets
- Document remaining skips (if any)

## üîß TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS

### Common Patterns for Enablement

#### 1. Async Dependency Injection Fix
```python
# Pattern for fixing async dependency issues
@pytest.fixture
async def async_client_with_auth():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as client:
        # Setup auth headers
        client.headers.update({"Authorization": "Bearer test-token"})
        yield client
```

#### 2. External Service Mocking
```python
# Pattern for mocking external services
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def mock_external_services():
    with patch.multiple(
        'app.services.integrated_payment_service',
        wompi_service=MagicMock(),
        email_service=MagicMock(),
        sms_service=MagicMock()
    ):
        yield
```

#### 3. Database Performance Optimization
```python
# Pattern for optimizing database tests
@pytest.fixture
def fast_db_session():
    # Use in-memory SQLite for speed
    engine = create_async_engine("sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:")
    yield engine
```

#### 4. Dependency Override Pattern
```python
# Pattern for proper dependency overrides
@pytest.fixture
def override_dependencies():
    app.dependency_overrides[get_current_user] = lambda: test_user
    app.dependency_overrides[get_db] = lambda: test_db
    yield
    app.dependency_overrides.clear()
```

## üö® RISK MITIGATION

### Potential Blockers
1. **Environment Variable Issues**: SECRET_KEY and other config
2. **Database Migration Conflicts**: Test database schema
3. **Async Pattern Complexity**: Proper async test setup
4. **External Service Dependencies**: Comprehensive mocking

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Environment Setup**: Standardized test environment configuration
2. **Database Isolation**: Proper test database setup and teardown
3. **Async Best Practices**: Documented patterns for async testing
4. **Mock Services**: Comprehensive mock library for external services

### Rollback Plan
If enablement causes issues:
1. **Immediate**: Re-skip problematic tests
2. **Short-term**: Fix issues and re-enable incrementally
3. **Long-term**: Refactor test architecture if needed
