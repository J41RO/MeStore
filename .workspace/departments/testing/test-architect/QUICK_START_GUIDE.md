```

## üìä CURRENT STATUS ASSESSMENT

### Test Coverage Analysis
- **Total Tests**: 2,097 collected
- **Passing Tests**: 93 (4.4%)
- **Skipped Tests**: 158 (7.5%)
- **Failing Tests**: 1 (critical E2E test)
- **Coverage Estimate**: 40-50%

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **Payment System**: 0% coverage - CRITICAL BUSINESS RISK
2. **Authentication**: Security failures - CRITICAL SECURITY RISK
3. **Order Processing**: Skipped tests - CRITICAL REVENUE RISK
4. **Vendor Management**: 0% coverage - CORE BUSINESS RISK

## üèóÔ∏è 4-WEEK ROADMAP

### Week 1: Foundation Stabilization
- **Target**: Enable critical authentication and payment tests
- **Coverage Goal**: 60%+
- **Key Deliverable**: Zero failing critical tests

### Week 2: Core Business Logic
- **Target**: Enable order processing and vendor management
- **Coverage Goal**: 70%+
- **Key Deliverable**: All critical business flows tested

### Week 3: Advanced Features
- **Target**: Commission system, analytics, search
- **Coverage Goal**: 80%+
- **Key Deliverable**: Complete business logic coverage

### Week 4: Quality & Performance
- **Target**: Performance optimization, quality gates
- **Coverage Goal**: 85%+
- **Key Deliverable**: Production-ready test suite

## üîß TOOLS AND COMMANDS

### Coverage Analysis
```bash
# Generate coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html

# Coverage by module
python -m pytest --cov=app.services --cov-report=term-missing

# Fast test execution for specific modules
python -m pytest tests/unit/services/ -v --tb=short
```

### Test Enablement
```bash
# Find all skipped tests
grep -r "@pytest.mark.skip" tests/

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest -m "auth" -v
python -m pytest -m "payments" -v
python -m pytest -m "tdd" -v
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Test execution time analysis
python -m pytest --durations=10

# Memory usage monitoring
python -m pytest --profile

# Parallel test execution
python -m pytest -n auto
```

## üìã DAILY CHECKLIST

### Morning Review (15 minutes)
- [ ] Check test execution results from CI/CD
- [ ] Review coverage reports
- [ ] Identify new failing tests
- [ ] Prioritize daily activities

### Midday Coordination (30 minutes)
- [ ] TDD Specialist progress check
- [ ] Agent communication review
- [ ] Blocker identification and resolution
- [ ] Afternoon priorities adjustment

### End of Day Summary (15 minutes)
- [ ] Document progress in TODO list
- [ ] Update coordination communications
- [ ] Plan next day priorities
- [ ] Escalate blockers if needed

## üö® CRITICAL BLOCKERS TO RESOLVE

### 1. Environment Configuration (IMMEDIATE)
```
Issue: SECRET_KEY environment variable missing
Impact: Authentication tests failing
Solution: Coordinate with security-backend-ai
Timeline: Today
```

### 2. Database Test Isolation (HIGH PRIORITY)
```
Issue: Test database contamination
Impact: Inconsistent test results
Solution: Implement proper fixtures
Timeline: 2 days
```

### 3. External Service Mocking (HIGH PRIORITY)
```
Issue: Wompi payment service not mocked
Impact: Payment tests cannot run
Solution: Create comprehensive mock service
Timeline: 3 days
```

## üìû KEY CONTACTS

### Primary Collaborators
