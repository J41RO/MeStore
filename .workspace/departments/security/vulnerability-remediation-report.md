# AFTER (SECURE):
except Exception as e:
    logger.critical("Critical fraud detection failure - SECURITY ALERT", error=str(e), email=email)
    # SECURITY FIX: Fail-secure behavior - treat system failure as HIGH RISK
    critical_alert = FraudAlert(
        alert_type=AlertType.FRAUD_DETECTION,
        severity=AlertSeverity.CRITICAL,
        message=f"Fraud detection system failure for {email}",
        details={"error": str(e), "email": email, "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()},
