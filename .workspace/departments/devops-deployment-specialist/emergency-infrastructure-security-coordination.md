## üîç VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS:
**Infrastructure Security Validation Process:**

### Secrets Management Validation:
1. **Secrets Elimination Confirmation:**
   ```bash
   # Scan for hardcoded secrets
   grep -r "password\|secret\|key" /home/admin-jairo/MeStore/ --exclude-dir=.git
   # Should return NO hardcoded credentials

   # Verify environment-based configuration
   env | grep -E "(DATABASE|REDIS|JWT|SECRET)"
   # Should show properly configured environment variables
   ```

2. **Database Security Testing:**
   ```bash
   # Test database connection security
   psql "postgresql://mestocker_user@localhost:5432/mestocker_dev"
   # Should require proper authentication

   # Verify encryption in transit
   netstat -an | grep 5432
   # Should show encrypted connections
   ```

3. **Redis Security Validation:**
   ```bash
   # Test Redis authentication
   redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 info
   # Should require authentication

   # Verify Redis configuration security
   redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 config get "*"
