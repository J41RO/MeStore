# üìã VERIFIED CONTEXT:
- Technology Stack: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + React Router
- Current State: ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL VERIFIED - Frontend running on 192.168.1.137:5173
- Hosting Preparation: Dynamic configuration with environment variables
- Dynamic Configuration: Env vars configured for API endpoints and development

# üéØ ENTERPRISE TASK:
**FRONTEND BUYER ROUTING CLIENT-SIDE RENDERING FIX**

‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPENDENCY:** This task is BLOCKED until backend User-Agent verification is completed first.

Fix client-side routing issue where buyer routes (/buyer/orders, /tracking, /app/compras, /app/mis-compras) return index.html instead of properly rendered React components.

**MEASURABLE SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
1. Route /buyer/orders displays BuyerOrdersNew component with actual content
2. Route /tracking displays OrderTracking component with order tracking functionality
3. Route /app/compras redirects properly to /app/mis-compras
4. Route /app/mis-compras displays BuyerOrdersNew component within BuyerLayout
5. All routes render React components, not 3328-byte index.html fallback
6. Navigation from BuyerLayout works correctly to all buyer routes
7. Authentication guards function properly for buyer-specific routes

# ‚ö†Ô∏è INTEGRATED AUTOMATIC HOSTING PREPARATION:
**MANDATORY DYNAMIC CONFIGURATION PATTERNS:**
- Use environment variables for API endpoints in all service calls
- Configure base URLs dynamically for different environments
- Implement proper error boundaries with environment-specific error handling
- Use dynamic authentication configurations for development/production

# üîç MANDATORY ENTERPRISE MICRO-PHASES:

## MICRO-PHASE 1: Route Component Investigation (15 min)
- Verify App.tsx routing configuration (lines 344-366)
- Test BuyerOrdersNew component renders independently
- Test OrderTracking component renders independently
- Identify if components are failing to load or authenticate

## MICRO-PHASE 2: Authentication Integration Check (20 min)
- Verify AuthGuard components work with buyer routes
- Test JWT token validation in browser network tab
- Confirm RoleGuard allows UserType.BUYER access
- Check if authentication redirects are causing issues

## MICRO-PHASE 3: BuyerLayout Navigation Fix (15 min)
- Verify BuyerLayout navigation links point to correct routes
- Update navigation to use React Router Link components if needed
- Test navigation flow from BuyerDashboard to order pages
- Ensure active route highlighting works properly

## MICRO-PHASE 4: Component Loading & Error Handling (20 min)
- Implement proper error boundaries for buyer routes
- Add loading states for lazy-loaded components
- Verify Suspense fallbacks display correctly
- Test error scenarios (network failures, authentication issues)

## MICRO-PHASE 5: Complete Integration Testing (15 min)
- Test all buyer routes with proper authentication
- Verify data loading from backend APIs (after backend fix)
- Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- Confirm no console errors or warnings

# ‚úÖ ENTERPRISE DELIVERY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Route /buyer/orders renders BuyerOrdersNew component correctly
- [ ] Route /tracking renders OrderTracking component correctly
- [ ] Route /app/compras redirects to /app/mis-compras properly
- [ ] Route /app/mis-compras displays within BuyerLayout correctly
- [ ] All routes return React-rendered content, not index.html
- [ ] Authentication guards work for all buyer routes
- [ ] Navigation from BuyerLayout functions properly
- [ ] Loading states and error boundaries implemented
- [ ] Responsive design works across devices
- [ ] No console errors or TypeScript warnings
- [ ] Dynamic configuration implemented for all API calls
- [ ] Performance optimized with proper lazy loading
- [ ] Error handling provides user-friendly messages
- [ ] Ready for production hosting deployment

**PRIORITY:** CRITICAL - Awaiting backend verification completion
**ESTIMATED TIME:** 85 minutes
**DEPENDENCIES:** Backend User-Agent fix must be completed first

**SPECIAL NOTES:**
- DO NOT START until backend verification confirms API access works
- Focus on why React components aren't rendering instead of falling back to index.html
- Pay special attention to authentication flow and token handling
- Ensure proper integration with existing BuyerLayout navigation system
