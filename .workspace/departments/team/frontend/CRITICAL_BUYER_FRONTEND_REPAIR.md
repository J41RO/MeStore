## üìã VERIFIED CONTEXT:
- Technology Stack: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Zustand + Tailwind CSS
- Current State: ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL VERIFIED - Frontend operational at 192.168.1.137:5173
- Hosting Preparation: Environment variables configured via frontend/src/utils/env.ts
- Dynamic Configuration: ‚úÖ DETECTED - API_BASE_URL from environment

## üéØ ENTERPRISE TASK:
**CRITICAL:** Repair buyer frontend authentication flow and dashboard system

**SPECIFIC FAILURE EVIDENCE:**
- Login button remains "Ingresar" after buyer login attempt
- User not redirected to buyer dashboard after successful authentication
- AuthStore not recognizing BUYER user type properly

2. Successful login redirects to buyer dashboard (/buyer/orders or /app/dashboard)
3. AuthStore properly manages BUYER user session
4. Buyer can access "Mis √ìrdenes" and see 6 orders
5. Buyer navigation sidebar shows correct options
