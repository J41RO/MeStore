## üìã VERIFIED CONTEXT:
- Technology Stack: FastAPI + Python 3.11 + SQLAlchemy + JWT Authentication
- Current State: ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL VERIFIED - Backend API operational at 192.168.1.137:8000
- Hosting Preparation: Dynamic configuration with environment variables implemented
- Dynamic Configuration: ‚úÖ DETECTED - Environment variables properly configured

## üéØ ENTERPRISE TASK:
**CRITICAL:** Repair buyer authentication system completely non-functional

**SPECIFIC FAILURE EVIDENCE:**
- Buyer login (buyer@mestore.com / 123456) fails to authenticate properly
- JWT token generation/validation broken for BUYER user type
- User session not maintained after login attempt
- Login button remains "Ingresar" instead of showing authenticated state
- API calls for buyer orders returning authentication errors

**MEASURABLE SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
1. Buyer credentials (buyer@mestore.com / 123456) authenticate successfully
2. JWT token generated and validated correctly for BUYER role
3. POST /api/v1/auth/login returns valid token for buyer
4. GET /api/v1/auth/me returns correct buyer user data
5. GET /api/v1/orders/buyer/ returns buyer orders (should show 6 orders)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è INTEGRATED AUTOMATIC HOSTING PREPARATION:
- Maintain all existing environment variable patterns
- Ensure JWT_SECRET_KEY properly configured from environment
- Database connections using environment variables only
- No hardcoded URLs or credentials in any code
- All authentication endpoints must work with dynamic configuration

## üîç MANDATORY ENTERPRISE MICRO-PHASES:

### PHASE 1: Authentication Diagnosis (15 min)
- Verify buyer user exists in database with correct password hash
- Test JWT token generation specifically for BUYER user type
- Check UserType enum includes BUYER correctly
- Verify /api/v1/auth/login endpoint functionality

### PHASE 2: JWT System Repair (25 min)
- Fix JWT token creation for buyer user
- Ensure JWT payload includes correct user_id and user_type
- Verify JWT secret key configuration from environment
- Test token validation and decoding

### PHASE 3: Session Management Fix (20 min)
- Repair user session maintenance after login
- Fix /api/v1/auth/me endpoint for authenticated buyers
- Ensure proper user context in API calls
- Verify role-based access control for buyer endpoints

### PHASE 4: API Endpoints Verification (15 min)
- Test /api/v1/orders/buyer/ endpoint functionality
- Verify buyer orders data retrieval (should return 6 orders)
- Check all buyer-specific API endpoints work properly
- Ensure proper error handling and responses

### PHASE 5: Integration Testing (10 min)
- Complete end-to-end authentication flow test
- Verify buyer login ‚Üí token ‚Üí authenticated calls ‚Üí data retrieval
- Test with actual buyer credentials: buyer@mestore.com / 123456
- Document specific fixes implemented

## ‚úÖ ENTERPRISE DELIVERY CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Buyer authentication fully functional
- [ ] JWT token generation/validation working for BUYER role
- [ ] POST /api/v1/auth/login successful with buyer credentials
- [ ] GET /api/v1/auth/me returns correct buyer user data
- [ ] GET /api/v1/orders/buyer/ returns buyer orders (6 orders expected)
- [ ] All authentication endpoints work with environment variables
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or URLs introduced
- [ ] Error handling properly implemented
- [ ] Session management maintains buyer authentication state
- [ ] Role-based access control functional for buyer role
- [ ] Integration tests pass for complete authentication flow
- [ ] Documentation of specific repairs made

**CRITICAL PRIORITY:** This is blocking core user functionality. Complete repair required before frontend coordination can proceed.

**BACKEND SPECIALIST ASSIGNMENT:** @backend-senior-developer - Execute immediate repair of buyer authentication system.
