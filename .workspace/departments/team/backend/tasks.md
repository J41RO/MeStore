Status: Agent activated and ready for Phase 9 MVP - Order Management System Implementation
=== ANALYZING ORDER MODEL FOR PHASE 9 REQUIREMENTS Sat Sep 13 03:10:08 AM -05 2025 ===
Analysis: Current Order model has good foundation with OrderStatus enum and basic timestamps
- OrderStatus includes: PENDING, CONFIRMED, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED, REFUNDED
- Timestamps: confirmed_at, shipped_at, delivered_at are present
- Missing: processing_at timestamp for workflow completeness
- Product-Vendor relationship: Products have vendedor_id linking to User
NEXT: Implement vendor-specific order endpoints for dashboard
=== TASK COMPLETED Sat Sep 13 03:15:25 AM -05 2025 ===
