## üîç VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS:
**Security Testing Validation Process:**

### For Each Critical Vulnerability:

1. **Pre-Fix Vulnerability Confirmation:**
   - Create test that demonstrates the security vulnerability exists
   - Document the exploitation method and potential impact
   - Record evidence of successful vulnerability exploitation

2. **Post-Fix Validation Testing:**
   - Execute same vulnerability test to confirm fix effectiveness
   - Validate that security fix prevents all exploitation attempts
   - Test edge cases and alternative attack vectors

3. **Regression Impact Testing:**
   - Confirm existing functionality remains completely intact
   - Test user workflows to ensure zero functional impact
   - Validate API contracts and responses remain unchanged

4. **Performance Impact Validation:**
   - Measure performance before and after security fixes
   - Ensure security improvements don't degrade system performance
   - Test system under load with security enhancements active
