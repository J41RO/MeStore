- Coverage Reporting: ✅ ACTIVE (32.96% current coverage)
- Test Isolation: ✅ WORKING (async session per test)

### 📋 TESTING COMMANDS FOR PRODUCTION:
```bash
# Run core tests
python -m pytest tests/core/ tests/api/ -v --cov=app

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=term-missing

# Run only passing test categories
python -m pytest tests/api/ tests/core/ tests/debugging/ -v
```

=== COMPREHENSIVE TEST ANALYSIS STARTED Sun Sep 14 04:32:11 PM -05 2025 ===
CRITICAL FINDING: Commission API test failing due to async session issues
Root Cause: Factory-boy using sync commits with async SQLAlchemy sessions
Impact: RuntimeWarning - coroutine AsyncSession.commit was never awaited
Status: Under investigation - fixing async compatibility
=== SCHEMA INCONSISTENCY DETECTED Sun Sep 14 04:38:58 PM -05 2025 ===
CRITICAL: User.id is UUID but Order.buyer_id references Integer
Impact: Foreign key constraint failure in database
Status: Schema mismatch requires migration fix
