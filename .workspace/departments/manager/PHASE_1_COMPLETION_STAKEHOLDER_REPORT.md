## STAKEHOLDER VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS

### üß™ HOW TO TEST THE SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS

#### Step 1: Access the System
1. Navigate to: **http://192.168.1.137:5173**
2. Login with test credentials: **super@mestore.com** / **123456**
3. Verify successful authentication and dashboard access

#### Step 2: Test Core Security Features
1. **Authentication Security:**
   - Attempt multiple failed logins - system should lockout after attempts
   - Verify session management - concurrent sessions should be controlled
   - Test logout functionality - sessions should be properly terminated

2. **Financial Transaction Security:**
   - Access commission calculations (if available in UI)
   - Verify all financial data displays correctly
   - Test transaction history access and integrity

3. **Permission System:**
   - Test different user roles and access levels
   - Verify admin functions are properly restricted
   - Confirm no unauthorized access to sensitive features

#### Step 3: Verify System Stability
1. **Performance Validation:**
   - System should respond within 2 seconds for all operations
   - No error messages or system crashes during normal use
   - All UI components should render correctly

2. **API Functionality:**
   - Visit: **http://192.168.1.137:8000/docs** for API documentation
