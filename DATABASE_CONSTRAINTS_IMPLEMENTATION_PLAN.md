## 🚀 EXECUTION PLAN

### Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Review complete audit report
- [ ] Understand all constraints being added
- [ ] Backup database (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Coordinate with backend and testing teams
- [ ] Schedule maintenance window (recommended)

### Step 1: Pre-Validation (1-2 days)

#### 1.1 Run Data Validation Script
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /home/admin-jairo/MeStore

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run validation in report-only mode
python scripts/validate_constraint_data.py --report-only

# Review output for violations
```

**Expected Output**:
```
DATABASE CONSTRAINT VALIDATION
========================================
ORDERS TABLE VALIDATION
✅ Negative subtotals: PASS
✅ Negative tax amounts: PASS
...

VALIDATION SUMMARY
Total Violations Found: 0
✅ DATABASE IS READY FOR CONSTRAINT MIGRATION
```

#### 1.2 Fix Any Violations Found

If validation finds violations:

```bash
# Review detailed violation report
cat scripts/constraint_validation_report.json

# Fix data manually or with cleanup scripts
# Example: Fix negative subtotals
UPDATE orders SET subtotal = 0 WHERE subtotal < 0;

# Re-run validation
python scripts/validate_constraint_data.py --report-only
```

**DO NOT PROCEED** until validation passes with 0 critical violations.

### Step 2: Development Testing (3-5 days)

#### 2.1 Test on Development Database

```bash
# Switch to development database
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./dev_test.db"

# Or for PostgreSQL dev:
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/mestore_dev"

# Apply migration
alembic upgrade head

# Verify constraints active
python scripts/verify_constraints.py

# Run full test suite
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Check application behavior
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

#### 2.2 Test Constraint Behavior

Create test cases to verify constraints work:

```python
# Test negative order total (should fail)
def test_negative_order_total_rejected():
    """Verify negative order totals are rejected"""
    order = Order(
        subtotal=-10.00,  # Should violate constraint
        total_amount=-10.00
    )
    with pytest.raises(IntegrityError):
        db.add(order)
        db.commit()

# Test zero quantity (should fail)
def test_zero_quantity_rejected():
    """Verify zero quantity order items are rejected"""
    item = OrderItem(
        quantity=0,  # Should violate constraint
        unit_price=10.00
    )
    with pytest.raises(IntegrityError):
        db.add(item)
        db.commit()
```

#### 2.3 Test Rollback

```bash
# Test downgrade works
alembic downgrade -1

# Verify constraints removed
# Try inserting invalid data (should succeed now)

# Re-apply migration
alembic upgrade head
```

### Step 3: Staging Deployment (2-3 days)

#### 3.1 Backup Staging Database

```bash
# PostgreSQL backup
pg_dump mestore_staging > staging_backup_pre_constraints_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# SQLite backup
cp mestore_staging.db mestore_staging_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

#### 3.2 Run Validation on Staging

```bash
# Point to staging database
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@staging/mestore"

# Run validation
python scripts/validate_constraint_data.py --report-only

# Fix any violations found
```

#### 3.3 Apply Migration to Staging

```bash
# Generate SQL for review
alembic upgrade head --sql > migration_constraints.sql

# Review SQL before executing
less migration_constraints.sql

# Apply migration
alembic upgrade head

# Verify constraints
python scripts/verify_constraints.py
```

#### 3.4 Staging Testing

- Run full regression test suite
- Test all payment flows
- Test order creation/modification
- Test product management
- Test user operations
- Monitor for constraint violations in logs

### Step 4: Production Deployment (Week 3)

#### 4.1 Pre-Production Checklist

- [ ] Staging tests passed for 48+ hours
- [ ] No constraint violations in staging logs
- [ ] Backup strategy confirmed
- [ ] Rollback plan tested
- [ ] Maintenance window scheduled
- [ ] Team notified of deployment
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

#### 4.2 Production Backup (CRITICAL)

```bash
# Full database backup
pg_dump mestore_production > prod_backup_pre_constraints_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup integrity
pg_restore --list prod_backup_pre_constraints_*.sql

# Store backup in secure location
aws s3 cp prod_backup_pre_constraints_*.sql s3://mestore-backups/critical/
```

#### 4.3 Run Production Validation

```bash
# Connect to production (read-only check)
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://readonly_user:pass@prod/mestore"

# Run validation
python scripts/validate_constraint_data.py --report-only

# If violations found, fix in maintenance window before migration
```

#### 4.4 Apply Migration to Production

```bash
# During maintenance window
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://admin_user:pass@prod/mestore"

# Final validation
python scripts/validate_constraint_data.py --report-only

# Generate SQL for final review
alembic upgrade head --sql > production_migration.sql

# Apply migration with monitoring
time alembic upgrade head 2>&1 | tee migration_output.log

# Immediate verification
python scripts/verify_constraints.py

# Check application startup
systemctl restart mestore-api
systemctl status mestore-api
```

#### 4.5 Post-Deployment Monitoring (24-48 hours)

Monitor for:
- Constraint violation errors in logs
- Application errors related to data validation
- Performance degradation on queries
- User-reported issues with orders/payments

```bash
# Monitor logs for constraint violations
tail -f /var/log/mestore/api.log | grep "IntegrityError"

# Check database performance
psql mestore_production -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';"

# Monitor error rates
curl http://monitoring.mestore.com/api/errors?timeframe=24h
```

---

## 🔄 ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### Immediate Rollback (If Migration Fails)

```bash
# Rollback migration immediately
alembic downgrade -1

# Verify application works
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Restore from backup if needed
pg_restore -d mestore_production prod_backup_pre_constraints_*.sql
```

### Partial Rollback (Specific Constraint)

If a specific constraint causes issues:

```sql
-- Drop specific constraint
ALTER TABLE orders DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS ck_order_total_positive;

-- Or use migration downgrade and selective re-apply
alembic downgrade -1
# Then manually apply only needed constraints
```

### Full Rollback with Data Restoration

If data corruption occurs:

```bash
# Stop application
systemctl stop mestore-api

# Drop database
dropdb mestore_production

# Recreate database
createdb mestore_production

# Restore from backup
pg_restore -d mestore_production prod_backup_pre_constraints_*.sql

# Verify data integrity
python scripts/validate_database_integrity.py

# Restart application
systemctl start mestore-api
```

## ⚠️ RISK MITIGATION

### High-Risk Scenarios

1. **Existing Invalid Data**
   - **Risk**: Migration fails due to constraint violations
   - **Mitigation**: Mandatory validation script before migration
   - **Fallback**: Data cleanup scripts provided

2. **Production Downtime**
   - **Risk**: Migration takes longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Tested on staging with production-size data
   - **Fallback**: Maintenance window scheduled, rollback plan ready

3. **Application Compatibility**
   - **Risk**: Application code relies on accepting invalid data
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing on staging
   - **Fallback**: Application code updates prepared in advance

4. **Performance Degradation**
   - **Risk**: Constraint checks slow down INSERTs/UPDATEs
   - **Mitigation**: Indexes added for FK columns
   - **Fallback**: Monitor performance, optimize queries if needed

### Medium-Risk Scenarios

1. **Cascade Deletions**
   - **Risk**: Unexpected data deletion due to CASCADE
   - **Mitigation**: RESTRICT used where appropriate, CASCADE only where intended
   - **Fallback**: Backup available for restoration

2. **FK Constraint Locks**
   - **Risk**: Table locks during FK constraint addition
   - **Mitigation**: Execute during low-traffic maintenance window
   - **Fallback**: Schedule additional maintenance if needed
