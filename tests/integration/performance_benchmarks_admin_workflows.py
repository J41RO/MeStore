ðŸš¨ RED PHASE: Performance Benchmarks for Admin Workflows - SQUAD 2

MISSION: Define performance benchmarks for business-critical admin workflows
TARGET: Photo upload, quality assessment, approval/rejection processes
FOCUS: Performance requirements that should FAIL until optimization is implemented

These benchmarks establish performance requirements that will fail in RED phase
and drive optimization in GREEN phase implementation.

Performance Benchmark Scope:
- Photo upload processing speed
- Quality assessment database performance
- Bulk workflow operation scalability
- Memory usage during complex operations
- Concurrent user handling capacity

Author: Integration Testing Specialist (Squad 2 Leader)
Date: 2025-09-21
Phase: RED (Test-Driven Development)
Purpose: Performance requirement validation
