RED PHASE TDD TESTS - Admin Security & Authorization

This file contains tests that are DESIGNED TO FAIL initially.
These tests define the expected security behavior for admin endpoints
focusing on authentication, authorization, and privilege escalation prevention.

CRITICAL: All tests in this file must FAIL when first run.
This is the RED phase of TDD - write failing tests first.
