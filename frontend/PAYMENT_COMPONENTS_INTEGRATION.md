  "message": "string"
}
```

## User Flow

### PayU Credit Card Flow
1. User selects "PayU - Tarjeta o PSE" payment method
2. PayUCheckout component renders with Credit Card tab selected
3. User enters card details (number, holder, expiry, CVV)
4. User selects installment plan
5. Client-side validation occurs
6. On submit, payment data is sent to `/api/v1/payments/process/payu`
7. Backend processes payment with PayU API
8. Success: `onSuccess` callback triggers, user proceeds to confirmation
9. Error: Error message displayed to user

### PayU PSE Flow
1. User selects "PayU - Tarjeta o PSE" payment method
2. User switches to PSE tab in PayUCheckout component
3. User selects bank and enters identification details
4. Client-side validation occurs
5. On submit, payment data is sent to `/api/v1/payments/process/payu`
6. Backend returns `payment_url` for bank portal redirect
7. User is redirected to bank portal to complete payment
8. After payment, user returns to `response_url`

### Efecty Flow
1. User selects "Efecty - Pago en Efectivo" payment method
2. EfectyInstructions component automatically requests payment code
3. Backend generates code and returns barcode + expiration
4. User sees payment code, barcode, and instructions
5. User can copy code or download/print page
6. User visits any Efecty office within 72 hours
7. After payment at Efecty, backend webhook updates order status
8. User receives confirmation email

## Styling & UX

### Design Tokens
- PayU brand color: Indigo (indigo-600)
- Efecty brand color: Orange/Yellow (yellow-600, orange-600)
- Tailwind CSS utility classes for consistent design
- Lucide React icons for visual elements

### Responsive Design
- All components are mobile-responsive
- Forms adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly buttons and inputs

### Accessibility
- Proper label associations
- ARIA attributes where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Validation
- Credit card number format (16 digits)
- Expiry date format (MM/YY)
- CVV length (3-4 digits)
- Required field validation
- ID number format

### API Error Handling
- Network errors caught and displayed
- Backend error messages shown to user
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Loading states prevent duplicate submissions

- [ ] Payment plan calculator for installments
- [ ] Efecty payment status polling/webhooks
- [ ] Email notifications for Efecty payments
- [ ] QR code for Efecty payment code

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Lazy load payment components

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: PayU payment fails with "Invalid card"
**Solution**: Verify card number is exactly 16 digits and valid Luhn check

**Issue**: Efecty code not generating
**Solution**: Check backend API is running and `/payments/process/efecty` endpoint is accessible

**Issue**: PSE redirect not working
**Solution**: Ensure `response_url` is whitelisted in PayU dashboard

**Issue**: Payment method not showing
**Solution**: Verify payment method is enabled in backend configuration

### Debug Mode
Enable console logging by checking browser DevTools:
- PayU payment data logged before API call
- Efecty code generation logged on success/failure
- Payment method selection changes logged
