| Get Admin Details | GET | `/admins/{admin_id}` | ✅ Working | Retrieves detailed admin user information |
| Update Admin User | PUT | `/admins/{admin_id}` | ✅ Working | Updates admin user data with validation |
| Get Admin Permissions | GET | `/admins/{admin_id}/permissions` | ✅ Working | Retrieves admin permission details |
| Grant Permissions | POST | `/admins/{admin_id}/permissions/grant` | ✅ Working | Grants permissions to admin users |
| Revoke Permissions | POST | `/admins/{admin_id}/permissions/revoke` | ✅ Working | Revokes permissions from admin users |
| Bulk Admin Actions | POST | `/admins/bulk-action` | ✅ Working | Performs bulk operations on admin users |

### 2. User Model Enhancements

**Status**: ✅ **ALL REQUIRED METHODS IMPLEMENTED**

```python
# Authorization Methods Added:
def is_superuser(self) -> bool
def is_admin(self) -> bool
def is_admin_or_higher(self) -> bool
