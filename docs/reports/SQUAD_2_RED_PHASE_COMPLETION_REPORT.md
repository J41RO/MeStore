## üéØ RED Phase Test Strategy

### Failure-Driven Design
All tests are designed to **fail initially** to expose missing implementations:

1. **Import Failures**: Tests attempt to import complex schemas and services
2. **Integration Gaps**: Tests expose missing cross-service communication
3. **Performance Failures**: Tests establish requirements that aren't met
4. **Business Logic Gaps**: Tests reveal missing business rule validation
5. **Error Handling Gaps**: Tests expose inadequate error handling

### Expected Failure Categories
- `QualityChecklistRequest` schema not fully implemented
- Complex workflow orchestration missing
- Performance optimization not implemented
- Business rule validation engine missing
- Audit compliance systems incomplete
- Cross-service integration gaps

## üöÄ GREEN Phase Preparation

### Ready for Implementation
Our RED tests establish clear requirements for GREEN phase implementation:

#### 1. Schema Implementation Required
```python
# Missing schemas that need implementation:
- QualityChecklistRequest (complex validation)
- PhotoUploadResponse (with metadata)
- WorkflowProgressResponse (state tracking)
- LocationAssignmentResponse (optimization results)
```

#### 2. Service Integration Required
```python
# Missing service integrations:
- Photo processing pipeline
- Notification service integration
- Business rule validation engine
- Audit compliance system
- Performance optimization layer
```

#### 3. Database Optimization Required
```python
# Performance optimizations needed:
- Query optimization for large datasets
- Index creation for analytics queries
- Transaction batching for bulk operations
- Connection pooling efficiency
```
