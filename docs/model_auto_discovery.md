# Model Auto-Discovery in Alembic

## Overview
The project now includes automatic model discovery for Alembic migrations. This means that new models are automatically detected without manual configuration of env.py.

## How it works

### 1. Automatic Import in env.py
The `alembic/env.py` file includes an `import_all_models()` function that:
- Uses `pkgutil.iter_modules()` to find all modules in `app/models/`
- Automatically imports all model modules
- Logs which models were found and imported
- Handles import errors gracefully

### 2. Auto-Import in models/__init__.py
The `app/models/__init__.py` file:
- Automatically imports all model modules when the package is imported
- Maintains an `__all__` list of available models
- Ensures models are registered with SQLAlchemy metadata

## Adding New Models

To add a new model:

1. Create your model file in `app/models/`:
```python
# app/models/product.py
from .base import BaseModel
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, Integer

class Product(BaseModel):
    __tablename__ = 'products'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(100), nullable=False)
    description = Column(String(500))
```

2. The model will be automatically discovered - no manual configuration needed!

3. Generate migration:
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add Product model"
```

## Verification

To verify auto-discovery is working:

```bash
# Check what models are detected
python3 -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('alembic')
from env import import_all_models
imported, failed = import_all_models()
print(f'Models found: {imported}')
"
```

## Performance

Auto-discovery typically takes < 1 second and only runs when:
- Alembic generates migrations
- The models package is first imported
- Running tests that clear metadata

Current performance: **0.473 seconds** for 2 models (EXCELLENT)

## Troubleshooting

If a model is not detected:

1. Ensure it inherits from `BaseModel`
2. Ensure it has a `__tablename__` attribute
3. Check that the file is in `app/models/` directory
4. Verify there are no import errors in the model file
