# Wompi Payment Integration with Fraud Detection

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive Wompi payment gateway integration with advanced fraud detection, commission calculation, and security features implemented for the MeStore marketplace.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **WompiService** - Enhanced payment gateway integration
2. **PaymentProcessor** - Main payment processing orchestrator
3. **WebhookHandler** - Secure webhook processing with signature validation
4. **PaymentCommissionService** - Automatic commission calculation on payment approval
5. **FraudDetectionService** - Real-time fraud analysis and prevention

### Enhanced Security Features

#### 1. Wompi Service Enhancements
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exception types
- Exponential backoff retry logic with jitter
- Circuit breaker pattern for reliability
- Rate limiting and connection pooling
- Enhanced webhook signature validation with timestamp verification
- PCI-DSS compliant card tokenization with validation

#### 2. Fraud Detection System
- **Real-time Analysis**: Pre-transaction fraud scoring
- **Risk Rules**: 11 comprehensive fraud detection rules
- **Risk Levels**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL
- **Actions**: ALLOW, REVIEW, DECLINE, BLOCK

### Fraud Detection Rules

#### Amount-Based Rules
- **High Amount Transaction**: Detects transactions exceeding user's normal patterns
- **Suspicious Amount Pattern**: Identifies round numbers and unusual patterns

#### Velocity-Based Rules
- **Rapid Transactions**: Multiple transactions in short timeframes
- **High Volume User**: Daily/weekly transaction limit violations

#### Behavioral Rules
- **New User High Value**: New accounts attempting large transactions
- **Unusual Time Pattern**: Transactions at suspicious hours

#### Technical Rules
- **Multiple Payment Attempts**: Failed attempts before success
- **Suspicious User Agent**: Bot detection and tool identification

#### Security Rules
- **Known Fraud Patterns**: Blacklist and fraud database checks
- **Duplicate Transaction**: Exact transaction duplicates

### Commission Integration

Automatic commission calculation triggered by payment approval:
- Real-time commission calculation on successful payments
- Refund adjustments for chargebacks
- Vendor notification system
- Audit logging for financial compliance

## API Integration Examples

### Processing a Card Payment with Fraud Detection

```python
# Enhanced payment processing with fraud detection
result = await payment_processor.process_card_payment(
    order_id=123,
    card_data={
        "number": "4111111111111111",
        "exp_month": "12",
        "exp_year": "2025",
        "cvc": "123",
        "card_holder": "John Doe"
    },
    customer_data={
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "full_name": "John Doe",
        "phone": "1234567890"
    },
    request_metadata={
        "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
        "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
        "session_id": "sess_12345"
    }
)

# Response includes fraud analysis
{
    "success": true,
    "transaction_id": "trx_12345",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "fraud_analysis": {
        "risk_level": "LOW",
        "risk_score": 15,
        "action": "ALLOW",
        "confidence": 0.95
    },
    "commission": {
        "commission_id": 456,
        "vendor_amount": 90.0,
        "platform_amount": 10.0
    }
}
```

### Webhook Processing with Commission Calculation

```python
# Webhook automatically triggers commission calculation
webhook_result = await webhook_handler.process_webhook(
    payload=webhook_payload,
    signature=request_signature,
    event_data=parsed_data
)

# Response includes commission processing
{
    "processed": true,
    "transaction_id": 123,
    "new_status": "APPROVED",
    "commission": {
        "success": true,
        "commission_id": 456,
        "vendor_amount": 90.0,
        "platform_amount": 10.0
    }
}
```
