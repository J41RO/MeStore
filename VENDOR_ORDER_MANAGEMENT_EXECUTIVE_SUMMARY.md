# Vendor Order Management System - Executive Summary

**Project**: Vendor Order Management System Implementation
**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Prepared by**: enterprise-product-manager AI
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Estimated Timeline**: 4 weeks
**Priority**: High

---

## Problem Statement

Currently, vendors (VENDOR users) in the MeStocker platform have **limited visibility and control** over orders containing their products. This creates operational inefficiencies and poor vendor experience:

- Vendors cannot see which orders include their products
- No way to update preparation status of their items
- Cannot track fulfillment progress
- No sales analytics for vendor performance
- Manual communication required for order coordination

---

## Proposed Solution

Implementation of a **complete Vendor Order Management System** with the following capabilities:

### Core Features

1. **Vendor Order Dashboard**
   - View all orders containing vendor's products
   - Filter by order status and preparation status
   - Search by order number
   - Pagination and real-time updates

2. **Item-Level Preparation Tracking**
   - New `preparation_status` field on order items
   - Status flow: pending → preparing → ready_to_ship → shipped
   - Vendor can update only their items
   - Timestamp tracking for audit trail

3. **Order Detail View**
   - Complete order information
   - Buyer contact details (limited for privacy)
   - Shipping address
   - Item-by-item status management
   - Visual preparation timeline

4. **Vendor Sales Analytics**
   - Total sales by period (day/week/month)
   - Orders pending preparation
   - Top selling products
   - Daily revenue breakdown

5. **Multi-Vendor Order Support**
   - Orders with multiple vendors' products
   - Each vendor sees only their items
   - Security isolation between vendors
   - Coordinated fulfillment tracking

---

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL)

**New Database Schema:**
```sql
-- OrderItem table additions
ALTER TABLE order_items ADD COLUMN preparation_status ENUM('pending', 'preparing', 'ready_to_ship', 'shipped');
ALTER TABLE order_items ADD COLUMN preparation_started_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE order_items ADD COLUMN ready_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE order_items ADD COLUMN shipped_at TIMESTAMP;
```

**New API Endpoints:**
```
GET    /api/v1/vendor/orders                    # List vendor's orders
GET    /api/v1/vendor/orders/{order_id}         # Get order details
PATCH  /api/v1/vendor/orders/{order_id}/items/{item_id}/status  # Update item status
GET    /api/v1/vendor/orders/stats              # Vendor sales stats
GET    /api/v1/vendor/orders/stats/products     # Top products
```

**Security:**
- JWT authentication required
- Vendor role validation
- Item-level access control (can only update own items)
- 403 Forbidden for unauthorized access
- Rate limiting: 100 requests/minute

### Frontend (React 19 + TypeScript)

**New Pages:**
- `/vendor/orders` - Order list with filters
- `/vendor/orders/:orderId` - Order detail view
- `/vendor/orders/stats` - Analytics dashboard

**Key Components:**
- `OrderCard` - Order summary card
- `OrderItemCard` - Item with status controls
- `StatusUpdateButton` - Quick status update
- `PreparationTimeline` - Visual timeline
- `OrderFilters` - Filter and search
- `StatsWidget` - Analytics widgets

**Mobile Optimization:**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Touch-optimized UI components
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Offline view capability (PWA)
