## 🏗️ TDD Methodology Implementation

### RED Phase Characteristics
✅ **All tests failing as expected** - Proper TDD implementation
✅ **Comprehensive failure scenarios** - Edge cases covered
✅ **Clear test intentions** - Business requirements captured
✅ **Security-first approach** - Attack vectors tested

### Test Structure
```python
@pytest.mark.red_test           # RED phase marker
@pytest.mark.data_management    # Functional category
@pytest.mark.admin_auth         # Security requirement
@pytest.mark.file_upload        # Feature-specific
async def test_name_fails():    # Clear failure expectation
    """RED: Clear description of expected failure"""
    # Test implementation with mocking
    # Assertions for expected failure conditions
```

### Markers Configuration
Updated `pytest.ini` with new markers:
- `data_management`: Data management functionality tests
- `admin_auth`: Tests requiring admin authentication
- `file_upload`: File upload functionality tests
- `workflow`: Workflow state management tests

## 🔒 Security Testing Highlights

### File Upload Security
- **Malicious File Type Prevention**: Rejects executables, scripts, non-image files
- **Oversized File Protection**: Enforces 10MB limit with proper error handling
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Sanitizes filenames containing `../` sequences
- **Image Processing Security**: Safe image processing with PIL/Pillow

### Injection Attack Prevention
- **SQL Injection**: UUID validation prevents SQL injection via queue_id
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization for verification notes and metadata
- **Path Traversal**: Filename validation for photo deletion endpoints

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Admin-Only Access**: All endpoints require admin authentication
- **Token Validation**: Proper JWT token validation and error handling
- **Permission Checking**: Multiple layers of authorization validation

## 📋 Test Execution Results

### Expected RED Phase Behavior
```bash
# Sample test execution showing proper RED phase failures
python -m pytest tests/unit/admin_management/test_admin_data_management_red.py -v

============================= FAILURES ===================================
- Authentication tests: FAILING with 401 (as expected - no real auth)
- Validation tests: FAILING with 422 (as expected - no validation)
- Business logic tests: FAILING with 400/500 (as expected - no logic)
- File upload tests: FAILING appropriately (as expected - no upload handling)
```

All tests are **failing as expected** in RED phase, confirming proper TDD implementation.
